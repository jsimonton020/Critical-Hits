# Critical-Hits
***This started off as a simple exercise to simulate dice rolls.
I've been adding to it overtime as a learning experience.***



This is a text based dice game with some rogue-lite elements.

If you roll the maximum value on a die, you get to roll the die again and add
 both dice rolls to get your final score. Critical hits can stack indefinitely,
 a second max value means you get a third roll, and so on. With enough luck,
 any number of points is possible.

 Enemies get progressively harder with each enemy downed.
 You get points for downing enemies, when you die you can spend points on
 upgrading your hp, size of die, or amount of dice.

Upgrading hp gives 20 more hp.
Upgrading size of die makes d4 to d6, d6 to d8, etc.
Adding a die will give you 1 more d4

The game ends when you defeat all the enemies.
