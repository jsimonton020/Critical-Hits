# Critical-Hits
This is a text based RPG-like dice game.

If you roll the maximum value on a die, you get to roll the die again and add
 both dice rolls to get your final score. Critical hits can stack indefinitely,
 a second max value means you get a third roll, and so on. With enough luck,
 any number of points is possible.
